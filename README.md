# Mafia-game-simulator
A mafia game simulator in Java

This assignment is about inheritance and polymorphism concepts which I was taught in my advanced programming course (fall 2020).

There is an abstract class named Player and other classes such as Doctor, Mafia, Villager, etc., are inhereted from that. And of course there are some abstract methods implemented by the childs. 

Details of the assigment are noted in the pdf file included in the repository.
