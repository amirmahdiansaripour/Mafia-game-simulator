# Mafia-game-simulator
A mafia game simulator in Java

This assignment is about inheritance and polymorphism concepts which I was taught in my advanced programming course (fall 2020).

There is an abstract class named Player and other classes such as Doctor, Mafia, Villager, etc., are inhereted from that; and of course there are some abstract methods implemented by the childs. 

Details of the assigment are noted in the pdf file included in the repository.

How to run:

1) Simply type `make`.

2) When .class files are made, type `java MafiaGame`.

3) Type the input (there is also a zip file named testcase which contains a simple test with its result).

At last, I would like to thank my course lecturer, Prof.Khosravi, who explained the concepts of the lesson greatly.
